 ## system design

## part 1
- a diagram is symbolic represention of information using visualization techniques
- characteristics of distributed system
- horizontal scaling vs vertical scaling
- job/work queue(  is system sofware ,a job queue (sometimes batch queue),is a data strusture main by job schudulet software containing job to run )
( work queue is a franmework for building large master-worker applications that span thousands of machines drawn from clusters,clouds,and grids)
- load balancing (load balancing (LB) is anather critical component of any distributed system)
- monolithic vs microservies(applocation has single code with multiple modules vs microservices are independently deployable services aroud a bissines domain)
- SQL vs noSQL( when is come to database tecnology,there's no one-size-fits-all solustion)
- caching ( caches in recently requested data is likely to be requested again, they are used in almost every layer of computing:hardware,operating systems,web browsers,web application ,and more)
- database indexing(indexing is a way to optimize the perfomance of a database by minimizing the number of disk accesses required whwn a query is processed)  
- database replication
